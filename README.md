# Database Design and Web Application Development Project

We designed a database in MySQL and developed a basic web application using Laravel to provide video streaming analytics.

To accomplish this, we designed a database schema that could store data about video streams and viewers, and implemented the database using MySQL. I then developed a basic web application using Laravel that connected to the database and provided analytics for video streams. This involved implementing features that allowed users to view analytics data and other useful stats like post impressions,liked videos etc.

Through completing this project, we demonstrated our understanding of database design and web application development using Laravel and MySQL, as well as my ability to create a simple functional web application that provides useful analytics data for video streams. I am excited to continue applying these skills and knowledge in future projects and opportunities.

This was a group project , and the team was composed of my two co-students Dimitrios, Anastasia and me . We all together designed the Database and its functions and later with the skills I developed in my internship I created a basic web app to connect out DB . This was a project for class ''DataBases'' of the winter semester of 2022-23 .
